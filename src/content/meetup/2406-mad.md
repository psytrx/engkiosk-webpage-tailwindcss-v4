    title: 'Production Undo'
    description: 'What would it take to have an "Undo" capability for Production? In this talk we explore how we can achieve this simple concept, and what it would mean for how we write and think about software development and deployment.'
    bio: 'Daniel worked the last couple of years rolling back software at Google. While he left SRE behind him, he still occasionally rants about the state of software release processes.'

    title: 'Binoculars powered by AI – Are you kidding?'
    description: 'This talk will take you on a journey of embedding AI models on the world’s first smart binocular. We look at the assumptions at the beginning of our project as well as the complexity of embedded software and the dependencies on other hardware components. We will discover the key learnings of our first prototype version and examine our current approach to meet user expectations. Besides the technical challenges when running AI models on an embedded hardware, you will get insights why in my opinion user experience plays an even more important role in AI applications than in others.'
    bio: 'Danielle is, above all, passionate about birds. She recently joined Swarovski Optik as a Data Engineer where she gets to combine her birding expertise with her interest in machine learning. Her role consists of evaluating and improving machine learning solutions that can be deployed on smart optical devices.
    
    Stefan has been working at Swarovski Optik on embedding software into sport optical solutions for more than six years now. Currently, his focus is on building up a highly capable in-house software development team. His background is in computer science, but starting with his research on wireless communication he has been diving deeper into embedded software; from bare metal real-time programming to running AI on dedicated hardware. He is passionate about building physical devices that are enriched with software features – such as the world’s first smart binocular.'
