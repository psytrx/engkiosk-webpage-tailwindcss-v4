    title: 'What the xz backdoor can teach us about supply chain security'
    description: "The recent discovery of a backdoor in the xz-utils package vividly demonstrates that supply chain attacks are not only a reality but also pose a significant threat. In this presentation, David and Richard will provide an overview of the attack on the open-source ecosystem and discuss supply chain attacks more broadly. The objective of this talk is to offer both a technical and a non-technical overview of the attack, offering insights that may help mitigate similar incidents in the future. Additionally, David and Richard will explore the potential impact of supply chain attacks on individuals and their software projects. This discussion aims to shed light on the broader implications of these attacks and provide guidance on safeguarding against them in an increasingly interconnected digital landscape."
