    title: 'How to unlock actionable insights from data'
    description: 'From a nice-to-have to a valuable insight — what does it really take to turn raw data into something actionable? In this session, I will take you on a journey through the process of transforming unstructured data into clear, business-driving insights. We’ll explore how to identify client needs, gather data from diverse sources, use powerful ETL/ELT tools and visualize the outcome with PowerBI.'
    bio: 'Theresa has a Bachelor’s degree in Management, Communication & IT from MCI Innsbruck, and a Master’s in Business Analytics & Big Data. After almost four years of analytical consulting for major Amazon advertisers, she shifted to freelancing, focusing on data analysis, consulting, and visualization. Outside of work, Theresa is an avid adventurer, spending her free time hiking/skiing in the mountains or catching waves, whether at the Eisbach in Munich or the ocean.'
